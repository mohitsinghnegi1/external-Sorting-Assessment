# external-Sorting-Assessment
All Sorting Algorithm works within the RAM .When the data to be sorted does not fit into the RAM and instead they resides in the slower external memory (usually a hard drive) , this technique is used . Example , If we have to Sort 100 numbers with each number 1KB and our RAM size is 10KB ,external merge sort works like a charm !.
